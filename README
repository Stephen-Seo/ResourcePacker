ResourcePacker - a file packer and pack reader for game resources

Compiling:

(using CMake)
make a build directory in the same directory src is contained in.
cd to that build directory
use command:
cmake ../src
to generate makefiles

To use options for install prefix or release build mode, run like this example:
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/stephen/Documents/ResourcePacker/build/install/ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src

After makefiles are generated, run make to compile.


Installing:

run make install to install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

by default, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is probably the root directory.
