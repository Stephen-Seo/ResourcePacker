127 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the first
    file in this packfile
8 bytes equal to location of the second file in this packfile
127 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the second
    file in this packfile
8 bytes equal to location of the third file in this packfile
127 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the third
