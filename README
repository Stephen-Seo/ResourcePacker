ResourcePacker - a file packer and pack reader for game resources

Compiling:

(using CMake)
make a build directory in the same directory src is contained in.
cd to that build directory
use command:
cmake ../src
to generate makefiles

To use options for install prefix or release build mode, run like this example:
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/stephen/Documents/ResourcePacker/build/install/ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src

After makefiles are generated, run make to compile.


Installing:

run make install to install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

by default, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is probably the root directory.


Format:
  Header
    Identifier           (5 bytes)
    Number of items      (16 bit / 2 bytes)
    location (per item)  (64 bit / 8 bytes)
    name (per item)      (128 bytes)
  Content
    (of variable size based on files packed in the packfile)

(for example, a packfile of 3 items will have a header such as:
5 bytes equal to the packfile's identifier
2 bytes equal to the number 3
8 bytes equal to location of the first file in this packfile
128 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the first
    file in this packfile
8 bytes equal to location of the second file in this packfile
128 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the second
    file in this packfile
8 bytes equal to location of the third file in this packfile
128 bytes containing a null-terminated string which is the name of the third
    file in this packfile)
